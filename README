 Description:
  This program reads or writes to an entire block device and records
  the time (in us) it took to process a certain amount of data.
  It features variable block sizes and grouping of results. This allows
  easier comparison of different experiments. For example, it is possible
  to have the average throughput at every 32MB of data by reading 32MB
  blocks (-b $[ 32 * 1048576] -g 1), 16MB blocks (-b $[ 16 * 1048576 ] -g 2)
  or even 1MB blocks (-b 1048576 -g 32).

  The output is in the form: O T, where:
   O - Offset (in bytes) where the operation was performed
   T - Time (us) to complete the operation

   The time is printed in microseconds and includes *only* the time spent
   during the I/O operations.


 Compiling:
  gcc -o dprofiler dprofiler.c -lrt -Wall -O3 -s


 Usage:
  ./dprofiler < -r | -w | -i > < -d dev_name >
             [ -hamyv[v] ] [ -b <buf_size> ] [ -g <grp_size> ] [ -o <datafile> ]

     One of the following operation modes must be selected:
     -r             Read from device.
     -w             Write to device (*CAUTION* This will overwrite the device).
     -i             Print information on the device and quit.
                    (default is -i)

     The device must be specified as follows:
     -d <dev_name>  For example: /dev/sdb

     The following options are available for both reading and writing:
     -b <buf_size>  Buffer size, in bytes.
                    (default is 1048576)
     -g <grp_size>  Amount of samples to group together in the output report.
     -o <datafile>  Name of the file to write the results.
                    (preferably on a different device than the one profiled)
     -h             Print the program usage.
     -a             Print cumulative average rate (if -r was also used).
     -m             Set output to MB/s instead of microseconds.
     -y             Open device with O_SYNC (see open(2) man page).
     -v             Print details of the device to stderr.
     -vv            Same as above, plus report to stdout apart from <datafile>.
                    (if no datafile is desired, use -o /dev/null)
